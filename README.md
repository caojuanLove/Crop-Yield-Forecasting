# Crop-Yield-Forecasting
Overview

This repository provides a complete workflow for regional crop yield prediction using multi-source remote sensing and meteorological data.
The framework integrates daily to 8-day scale environmental variables, vegetation indices, and soil properties, and applies LSTM models with hyperparameter optimization to predict and evaluate yield variability across regions.
The current example focuses on winter wheat in India, but the workflow is fully transferable to other crops and regions.

üîÅ Workflow Summary

The modeling workflow consists of 13 steps, grouped into data acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation phases.

Step	Script (renamed for clarity)	Description
1	01_GEE_Download_Daily_Meteorology_VI.txt	Run on Google Earth Engine (GEE) to download daily meteorological and vegetation index data. Includes ERA5-Land variables (temperature_2m, precipitation, solar_radiation, wind, dewpoint_temperature), computes VPD and wind speed, and extracts NDVI, EVI, and KNDVI from MCD43A4. Also merges weighted soil and spatial information (AWC, CEC_SOIL, CLAY, ORG_CARBON, PH_WATER, SAND, SILT, TOTAL_N, Lon, Lat, Elevation).

2	02_GEE_Download_8Day_GPP_LAI_FPAR.txt	Run on GEE to download 8-day GPP, LAI, and FPAR datasets for the target region.

3	03_Aggregate_Daily_to_8Day_Region.ipynb	Aggregate daily data to 8-day scale. Compute derived variables: CDD, HDD, GDD, and SPEI. Merge vegetation indices and link with regional yield data.

4	04_Select_GrowthStage_VI.ipynb	Select the optimum  vegetation indicator and extract three key growth-stage periods.

5	05_Select_Model_Features.ipynb	Choose the optimal combination of predictor variable  for regional model construction.

6	06_LSTM_Hyperparameter_Optimization.ipynb	Use Optuna to search for the best LSTM hyperparameter combination.

7	07_LSTM_Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb	Train the LSTM model using the optimal parameters. Evaluate performance on test years against a null model and estimate factor importance via permutation analysis.

8	08_Download_S2S_ECMWF_Reforecast.ipynb	Automatically download ECMWF Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) reforecast data for the forecast years.

9	09_GEE_Download_Historical_weather.txt	Run on GEE to download 30 years of daily historical weather data.

10	10_Process_Historical_Weather_to_8Day.ipynb	Convert historical 30-year weather data to 8-day format. Use actual weather data before the forecast period and historical 30-year weather data after it.For VI, use actual values before the forecast and the most similar historical year after it.

11	11_Process_S2S_Data_to_8Day.ipynb	Process S2S weather forecast data into 8-day scale inputs.Use actual weather data before the forecast period and S2S forecasts after it.For VI, use actual values before the forecast and the most similar historical year after it.

12	12_Apply_Trained_LSTM_to_Dynamic_Yield_Forecast.ipynb	Integrate S2S and historical weather data into trained LSTM models to assess 8-day dynamic forecast accuracy for lead weeks 1-12.

13	13_LSTM_Shapley_Factor_Importance.ipynb Import the trained model and modeling data to compute SHAP-based feature importance over time and by variable.
